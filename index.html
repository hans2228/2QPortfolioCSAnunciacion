    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>Two of the most well-known Clash Royale streamers, Jynxzi and Rhyly, have recently done much to draw the attention to the Clash Royale community. Both the creators are known to have hyper personality along with competitive nature that provides the viewers with fast matches, funny reactions, and smart plays that keep them glued to the content. Their content is unique and fun not only in regards to the gameplay but the humor and interaction they bring to each of the streams, which makes it even more fun.
        <p>Jynxzi, a former Rainbow Six Siege player entered into Clash Royale content, with his massive following and charisma in each stream. His transition to the mobile game shows that he is flexible as a content creator, and his streams are typically full of high-tier gameplay mixed with random and goofy moments that serve to highlight his enjoyable and unpredictable personality. The fans like to see him get angry, to win the matches, and to play unpredictable cards and stream on twitch.
            <p>Rhyly is, however, known to be a smooth commentator of the mechanics of the game. His manner of playing Clash Royale is more critical and he often breaks down games and gives tips which can help viewers play better. Despite the dissimilarity in their style, Rhyly and Jynxzi get along well when they mention each other in streams. These two streamers both popularized Clash Royale and sparked a new interest for most people.
